    "Data preparation is a *very* broad subject, covering everything from data models to statistical assessments of data to string algorithms to scalable data processing. In some sense, most of Data Engineering---most of data science!---boils down to Data Preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's first lecture we'll cover a few key topics:\n",
    "1. Data \"Unboxing\": parsing & structure assessment\n",
    "2. Structural Data Transformations\n",
    "3. Type Induction/Coercion\n",

    "## 1. \"Unboxing\" Data\n",
    "Recall some basic tools:\n",
    "- `du -h`: show the disk size of a file in human-readable form\n",
    "- `head -c 1024`: show me the first 1024 bytes of a file\n",
    "- your eyes: in addition to being the window to your soul, they're a very common tool for understanding data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing Structure\n",
    "Start by running `du -h` and `head -c 1024` on some files, or have a peek in your Finder/Explorer and favorite (scale-savvy) text editor.\n",
    "1. Look out for header info, metadata, comments, etc.\n",
    "  - They may be inline, or in external documentation, \"data dictionaries\", etc.\n",
    "2. Most files you'll run across fall into one of these categories:\n",
    "  1. **Record per line**: newline-delimited rows of uniform symbol-delimited data.\n",
    "    - E.g. `csv` and `tsv` files\n",
    "    - Also newline-delimited rows of uniform but ad-hoc structured text\n",
    "  2. **Dictionaries/Objects**: explicit key:value pairs, may be nested! Two common cases:\n",
    "    - Object-per-line: e.g. newline-delimited rows of JSON, XML, YAML, etc. (JSON in this format is sometimes called [json lines or jsonl](https://jsonlines.org/)).\n",
    "    - Complex object: the entire dataset is one fully-nested JSON, XML or YAML object\n",
    "  3. **Unions**: a mixture of rows from *k* distinct schemas. Two common cases:\n",
    "    - *Tagged Unions*: each row has an ID or name identifying its schema. Often the tag is in the first column.\n",
    "    - *Untagged Unions*: the schema for the row must be classified by its content\n",
    "  4. **Natural Language (prose)**: A lot of data files are mostly or entirely natural language intended for human consumption.\n",
    "  5. **Everything else**: There is a long tail of file formats in the world. If they're not readable as text, there's likely a commercial or open source tool to translate them to a readable text format.\n",
    "  \n",
    "One final note: text formats themselves are a complex issue. Traditionally there were two encodings of roman-alphabet characters: EBCDIC and ASCII. ASCII mostly won. But in our multilingual world, we now deal with characters from multiple languages and beyond ðŸ˜Ÿ! There are many character encodings now. We won't dwell on this subject in this class, but some day you may have to be aware of issues like Unicode, UTF-8 and more. You can search the web for resources on these issues.\n",
    "  \n",
    "For the rest of this class, we will focus on the common case of text that can be read and written easily in tools like Jupyter, Python, PostgreSQL, etc."

This is a visual environment for \"low-code\" dataprep that is the commercialization of joint research at Berkeley and Stanford in the [Wrangler](http://vis.stanford.edu/wrangler/) and [Potter's Wheel](http://control.cs.berkeley.edu/abc) projects.\n",

We may have to be a bit patient as Trifacta uploads the data to the cloud. The `tf.wrangle` call will upload the data and return a \"flow\" object from Trifacta. We can then call the `open()` method on that flow object to open the Trifacta UI in a new browser tab."

You can mouse over these to see what they would do, but eventually click on the suggestion to `Unpivot columns into rows`. You will get a split-screen preview of the result, which should look right. Click `Add` to accept the suggestion. You should now see one grid of data, transformed the way we like.

    "### PIVOT/UNPIVOT and the Relational Model??!\n",
    "We can do PIVOT/UNPIVOT in Trifacta, in Pandas, and in Spreadsheets. But can we do it in SQL?\n",
    "Before we answer that question, let's go to the foundations. Can we do this in Relational Algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the answer is a resounding *no*. Think about how we declare column values in relational algebra: we write an expression like $\\pi_{c1, c2, c3}(T)$. The subscripts of the $\\pi$ operator are part of the *syntax* of your relational expression---they *do not change* as the relation instance (the data in the database!) changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, for PIVOT the subscript of the $\\pi$ operator essentially needs to be \"the set of distinct values in the relation instance\", which *absolutely changes* as the relation instances changes. Similarly, UNPIVOT returns data values (an output instance) that come from the input *schema* which isn't allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you don't know what First Order Logic is, no sweat: you can safely skip this paragraph!*\n",
    "UNPIVOT hints at what's going on here. Relational languages are based on First Order Logic, in which the EXISTS and FORALL quantifiers range over the data in the instance. By contrast, UNPIVOT somehow has a quantifier that ranges over the variable (column) names. Logics that quantify over variable names are called Second Order Logic. They are strictly more expressive than First Order Logic, and as such also more computationally complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhow, \"pure\" SQL as we've learned it---an equivalent to the relational algebra---shouldn't be able to express PIVOT or UNPIVOT. However, given how useful this is, many SQL systems have (proprietary) extensions. They are often called PIVOT/UNPIVOT, though in Postgres the extension is called [crosstab](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tablefunc.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What about performance and scale\n",
    "Have you ever seen a table with 10 million rows? Sure! Have you ever seen one with 10 million columns? \n",
    "\n",
    "Many database systems and other data tools scale wonderfully in the number of rows, but lay an egg if you generate too many columns, or simply prevent you from doing so. There are exceptions to this rule, but it's a very common limitation. It's also sensible from a user experience perspective: wide tables are unwieldy to query (imagine almost any SELECT clause other than `SELECT *`!) Some tools like Trifacta will truncate your PIVOTs (and related operators that generate new columns) to prevent disasters, but the result is often non-deterministic in terms of which columns get added and which don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, \"wide matrices\" can also be unattractive. A wide matrix is basically a set of *very* high-dimensional vectors, and high dimensionality is traditionally hard in statistics (the so-called [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)). However in Machine Learning in recent years, high dimensionality has become more useful---in part because massive real-world data sets aren't uniformly distributed in the high-dimensional spaces that cause the curse. In essence, in real-world data there's some lower-dimensional embedding latent in most real-world data, but modern ML techniques can kind of find it. We will come back to this point later."

    "## 3. Type Induction and Coercion\n",
    "To begin let's review \"statistical\" data types. This is a slight refinement from the terms in DS100:\n",
    "- *nominal* / *categorical*: types that have no inherent ordering, used as names for categories\n",
    "- *ordinals*: types that are used to encode order. Typically the integers $1, 2, \\ldots$\n",
    "- *cardinals*: types that are used to express cardinality (\"how many\"). Typically the integers $0,1,\\ldots$. Cardinals are common as the output of statistics (frequencies).\n",
    "- *numerical* / *measures*: types that capture a numerical value or measurement. Typically a real (floating point) number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data types in the wild\n",
    "We've seen that some systems like databases keep data types as metadata, and enforce strong typing in storage when data is inserted or modified. Used carefully, databases will carry the data-type metadata along with the data when they communicate with tools or other databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "But it's very, very common to work with data that has little or no metadata. In that case, we *have* to interpret the data somehow. As a very first step, we need to guess (\"induce\") types for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques for Type Induction\n",
    "Suppose I give you a column of potentially dirty data. Suppose you have a set of types H. You need to write an algorithm to choose a type. How does it choose?\n",
    "- \"Hard\" Rules: E.g. Occam's razor. \n",
    "  - Try types from most- to least-specific. (e.g. boolean, int, float, string)\n",
    "  - Choose the first one that matches *all* the values.\n",
    "- Minimum Description Length (MDL): See below\n",
    "- Classification (i.e. Supervised Learning): You know how this goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MDL\n",
    "Intuition is similar to Occam's razor, but accounts for the \"weight\" or \"penalty\" of encoding exceptions to the best type. The \"fitness\" of a type to some data is the description length of the data using that type---including the cost of \"explicitly\" storing the data that doesn't fit the type as a string. Let's say $len(v)$ is the bit-length for encoding of a value $v$ \"explicitly\". Given a type $T$ with $|T|$ distinct values, the bit-length of encoding a value in that type is $log|T|$. (E.g. there are $2^64$ 64-bit integers, and each one is $log(2^64)=64$ bits long.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that indicator variable $I_T(v) = 1$ if $v \\in T$, and $0$ otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "For MDL, we choose the type that minimizes the description length for the set of data $c$ in a column:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_{T \\in H} \\sum_{v \\in c}(I_T(v)log(|T|) + (1-I_T(v))len(v))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a \"column\" of values: $\\{\\mbox{'Joe'}, 2, 12, 4750\\}$. Assume the default type is \"string\", which costs us 8 bits per character. \n",
    "- We can encode this as 3 16-bit integers and 'Joe': length is $3*16 + 3*8 = 72$\n",
    "- Or we can encode it all as strings: $(3 + 1 + 2 + 4)*8 = 80$.\n",
    "\n",
    "MDL would favor \"int16\" over \"string\" in this example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one can enhance MDL in various ways. One approach that's interesting to consider is to induce *compound* types: i.e. the string \"12/31/2021\" could be *string* or *date* or a compound type like *int4 '/' int8 '/' int16*. Another approach is to use compression techniques to get tighter measures for the length of encoding---for both type-matches and for strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In practice\n",
    "Some systems will break if the chosen type doesn't fit all the data in the column, in which case they'll choose a \"hard rules\" approach. For systems that can handle a mix of types, something like MDL is not unusual, though it may be more naive (e.g. pick the type that matched the largest number of entries).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Coercion/Casting\n",
    "You can explicitly set the type of a column. If the column has values that don't match the type, you will have to live with a lossy representation of those values (often NULL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typecasting can be useful for ensuring that a system treats your type right *statistically*. For example, ID columns are often arbitrary integers. These are not really numeric columns, they're categorical. To ensure the system/processes don't get confused, you can cast them to strings."
