# Syllabus
This new class on Data Engineering will cover the principles and practices of managing data at scale, with a focus on use cases in data analysis and machine learning. We will cover the entire life cycle of data management and science, ranging from data preparation to exploration, visualization and analysis, to machine learning and collaboration.

The class will balance foundational concerns with exposure to practical languages, tools, and real-world concerns. We will study the foundations of prevalent data models in use today, including relations, tensors, and dataframes, and mappings between them. We will study SQL as a means to query and manipulate data at scale, including performance concerns like views and indexes, query processing and optimization, and transactions, all from a user perspective. We will study the foundations and realities of data preparation, including hands-on work with real-world data using standard Python and SQL frameworks. We will explore data exploration modalities for non-programmers, including the fundamentals behind spreadsheet systems and interactive visual analytics packages. We will look at approaches for managing the machine learning lifecycle of data preparation, model selection and training, model serving and monitoring. Time permitting we will look at technologies for moving, sharing, and caching data including event streaming systems, key-value/document stores, log analytics, and search engines.

**For this year alone, if you have already taken CS (W)186 (or are planning to take it concurrently) or INFO 290 (human-in-the-loop data management), you will not be permitted to take this class.**

## Prerequisites
COMPSCI C100/DATA C100/STAT C100 or COMPSCI 189 or INFO 251 or DATA 144/INFO 254 or equivalent upper-division course in data science. COMPSCI 61A or COMPSCI 88 or INFO 206B or equivalent courses in programming. This class will not assume deep experience with databases or big data solutions.

## Communications
Please make sure you are enrolled on Piazza and Gradescope. Piazza is our primary method of communication and making announcements, and you are responsible for checking it frequently. We plan on using bCourses only for lecture webcasts. Gradescope is where all assignments are submitted.

## Grading
64% of your grade will come from projects, and 36% of your grade will come from multivitamins. There will be no exams in the course for this semester.

### Projects
Throughout the semester, we will release 4 programming assignments via Piazza and the website. There will also be a 5th extra credit project released towards the end of the semester.

### Multivitamins
Multivitamins are short assignments designed to keep you on schedule and check your understanding of the basics from lecture. They will mostly consist of multiple choice questions. If you are struggling with any of the questions on the multivitamin, you are encouraged to come to office hours for help. We will have 5 multivitamins throughout the semester.

## Office Hours
Office hours are a great place to go for help with multivitamins, projects, or any other content-related questions. You can find a list of office hours under the Staff tab on this page. The course calendar under the Calendar tab also shows the office hours for the week.

## Late Policy
You will get 4 slip days for projects and 4 slip days for multivitamins. Note that these are separate, so you will not receive extra project slip days if you do not use all of your multivitamin slip days. Likewise, using a slip day for a project will not use up one of your multivitamin slip days. Slip days are automatically used in the manner that will optimize your score the most. After using all of your project slip time, youâ€™ll be docked 25% of your score for the project each extra late day on your project submission. Late multivitamin submissions will not be accepted after you use up all of your multivitamin slip time. Note that submission times are rounded up to the next day. That is, 2 minutes late = 1 day late.

## Collaboration Policy
We do not allow for collaboration on assignments since we expect you to complete all assignments individually.

## Extensions
For administrative and logistics issues, deadline extension requests, alternate exam requests, DSP accommodations, or special accommodations (for emergencies or personal issues), please make a private post on Piazza. If you need an extension, please include your reason for requesting an extension and any relevant documentation if applicable. If you are a DSP student and your accommodation letter allows for extensions, please also contact us with your extension request so that we can work out an appropriate submission timeline. For issues that you do not feel comfortable with posting on Piazza, feel free to email Allen Shen or the professors. You may also attend their office hours to discuss these issues.
