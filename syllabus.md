# Syllabus

**Please note that the following syllabus is tentative and is subject to change.**

This new class on Data Engineering will cover the principles and practices of managing data at scale, with a focus on use cases in data analysis and machine learning. We will cover the entire life cycle of data management and science, ranging from data preparation to exploration, visualization and analysis, to machine learning and collaboration.

The class will balance foundational concerns with exposure to practical languages, tools, and real-world concerns. We will study the foundations of prevalent data models in use today, including relations, tensors, and dataframes, and mappings between them. We will study SQL as a means to query and manipulate data at scale, including performance concerns like views and indexes, query processing and optimization, and transactions, all from a user perspective. We will study the foundations and realities of data preparation, including hands-on work with real-world data using standard Python and SQL frameworks. We will explore data exploration modalities for non-programmers, including the fundamentals behind spreadsheet systems and interactive visual analytics packages. We will look at approaches for managing the machine learning lifecycle of data preparation, model selection and training, model serving and monitoring. Time permitting we will look at technologies for moving, sharing, and caching data including event streaming systems, key-value/document stores, log analytics, and search engines.

**For this year alone, if you have already taken CS (W)186 (or are planning to take it concurrently) or INFO 290 (human-in-the-loop data management), you will not be permitted to take this class.**

## Prerequisites

COMPSCI C100/DATA C100/STAT C100 or COMPSCI 189 or INFO 251 or DATA 144/INFO 254 or equivalent upper-division course in data science. COMPSCI 61A or COMPSCI 88 or INFO 206B or equivalent courses in programming. This class will not assume deep experience with databases or big data solutions.

<!-- TODO: Link to Gradescope and Piazza below
Before continuing, please make sure you are enrolled in the course Gradescope here, using your UC Berkeley credentials. Please also enroll in the course Piazza here, as Piazza is our primary method of communication and making announcements, and you are responsible for checking it frequently.

## Projects
Throughout the semester, we will release approximately 4 programming assignments via Piazza and the website.

## Multivitamins
Multivitamins are short assignments designed to keep you on schedule and check your understanding of the basics from lecture. If you are struggling with any of the questions on the multivitamin, you are encouraged to come to office hours for help. We will have approximately 5 multivitamins throughout the semester.

## Exams
There will be no exams in the course for this semester.

## Office Hours
Office hours are a great place to go for help with multivitamins, projects, or any other content-related questions. You can find a list of office hours under the Staff tab on this page. The course calendar under the Calendar tab also shows the office hours for the week.

## Extensions
Piazza is the main method of communication for this course, and all announcements about the course will be posted there. Join it ASAP if you havenâ€™t already. For administrative and logistics issues, deadline extension requests, alternate exam requests, DSP accommodations, or special accommodations (for emergencies or personal issues), please make a private post on Piazza. If you need an extension, please include your reason for requesting an extension and any relevant documentation if applicable. If you are a DSP student and your accommodation letter allows for extensions, please also contact us with your extension request so that we can work out an appropriate submission timeline. For issues that you do not feel comfortable with posting on Piazza, feel free to email Allen Shen or the professors. You may also attend their office hours to discuss these issues.
