Hi everyone! I’m a junior from the Bay Area majoring in EECS and Business. In my free time you can find me entertaining my growing poker addiction, speeding through Netflix shows, and playing basketball and table tennis. I also love trying new restaurants, especially Thai, and ice cream. I’m excited to help out this semester!
